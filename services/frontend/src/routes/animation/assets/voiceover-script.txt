Hello and welcome to your Spendcast Wrapped 2024! Let’s take a quick look back at your financial year and see the story your money tells. Ready? Let’s go.

In 2024, you spent 15,482 Swiss Francs across 246 transactions. Your biggest month was December, and your top category was Food & Groceries—no surprise there!

Month by month, your spending rose toward the holidays, peaking at over 2,300 francs in December. Despite that, you still managed to save consistently most months.

By category, Housing was the largest at 6,000 francs—about 39% of your total, right in line with financial recommendations. Food & Groceries came next, then Shopping, with the rest spread across entertainment, transport, and other essentials.

Your single biggest expense? Rent—1,250 francs a month, about 8% of your yearly spending. A healthy, manageable share.

On the income side, you earned 32,450 francs and spent 15,482. That means you saved nearly 17,000 francs—an amazing 52% savings rate. Way above the recommended 15–20%.

Looking at accounts, you have 3,240 francs in checking and 12,750 in savings, for a total of nearly 16,000. Your checking sees lots of activity, while your savings keep growing—great balance.

For savings goals, you’re 75% toward your emergency fund, over halfway on your vacation fund, and have 5,200 saved toward a car. In total, you’ve reached 38% of your long-term goals.

Your financial health score is an A-. Strong savings rate, housing costs under control, and low debt. The main area to improve is boosting your emergency fund to cover six months.

Recommendations? Build up that emergency fund, watch grocery spending, set up automatic savings transfers, and keep an eye on weekend splurges. Small tweaks could lift your financial health even higher next year.

Overall—fantastic work! You’ve saved a lot, kept spending balanced, and made real progress on goals. Keep it up, and your future self will thank you. Thanks for using Spendcast—we’ll see you in 2025!
